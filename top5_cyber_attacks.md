ðŸŽ¯Top 5 cyber attacks every SOC analyst should know:

1.Brute force attack on active directory
   -A Brute Force Attack is a trial-and-error method used to guess login credentials (username/password), encryption keys, or PINs by systematically trying every possible combination until the correct one is found.**
   -It is one of the oldest and simplest types of cyberattacks â€” but still very effective if protections are weak.

2.Pishing
 -Phishing is a social engineering attack where attackers impersonate trusted sources (like banks, services, or colleagues) to trick victims into revealing confidential information such as login credentials, credit card numbers, or downloading malware.
 
3.Ransomware
- Encrypts victim's data and demands payment (ransom) for the decryption key.
- Often spreads via phishing emails or drive-by downloads.
- Example: WannaCry, REvil, LockBit.

4. DDOS(distributed Denial of service)
  -A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is a cyberattack aimed at making a machine, server, or network unavailable to its intended users by overloading it with traffic or requests.
  -A Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack is a more powerful version where the attack comes from multiple compromised systems (botnet) at the same time.
 Real-World Examples:
â—‡ GitHub (2018): Faced a record-breaking 1.3 Tbps DDoS attack.

â—‡ Dyn (2016): DDoS attack on DNS provider affected Twitter, Netflix, Reddit.

â—‡ Banks & Governments: Frequently targeted for disruption or extortion.


5.Zero day exploit
  -A Zero-Day Exploit is a cyberattack that targets a software vulnerability unknown to the vendor or the public at the time of the attack.
â€¢ The term "zero-day" means developers have had zero days to fix the flaw â€” no patch exists yet
ðŸ”¸ Examples of Zero-Day Attacks:
1. Stuxnet (2010)
â—‡ Targeted Iranian nuclear facilities.

â—‡ Exploited four zero-day vulnerabilities in Windows.

â—‡ Caused physical damage to centrifuges.



â€¢ Log4Shell (2021)
â—‡ Critical vulnerability in Apache Log4j.

â—‡ Allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely on millions of servers.

â—‡ One of the most severe zero-days ever.



â€¢ Google Chrome Zero-Days (Multiple in 2023)
â—‡ Attackers exploited rendering engine flaws before patches were released.
